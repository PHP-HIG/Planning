# PHP Community Guidance

## Purpose

The purpose of this organization is to establish a guidance structure for
PHP community efforts, unified under a common philosophy of inclusion,
professionalism, respect, transparency, and civility.

Chiefly, the guiding idea behind the communities involved is that those
involved are mature professionals, and so we should be able to work out any
conflicts openly, honestly, and civilly.

## Communities

### \#\#phpcg (Freenode)

This channel is intended as the forum in which to discuss this project itself.

### \#\#phphelp (Freenode)

This channel is intended as a general PHP support channel, akin to the existing
\#\#php channel, but with clearer guidelines for ensuring that the support
provided is effective and clear.

### \#\#phptalk (Freenode)

This channel is intended as a general PHP community channel, akin to the
existing \#\#phpc channel, but more inclusive of all views, so long as those
views are expressed in a civil manner. Debate, criticism, politics, and general
friendliness are all expressly encouraged.

### \#phpmentoring (Freenode) (pending approval of founders)

### [/r/PHP](https://reddit.com/r/PHP) (pending approval of mods)

This subreddit already exists and has conduct guidelines which will serve as
a framework for the guidelines established for our communities.

## Code of Conduct

### Discussion

#### Civility

Above all else, civility is required. This means that at no point are direct
personal insults acceptable. This does not otherwise restrict what can be said,
so long as what is said is legal, and not excessively crude (extreme swearing,
intentionally offensive imagery, overt malicious trolling,
fundamentally derogatory language).

#### Inclusivity

As much as possible, all community members should try to be inclusive and
welcoming. This does not, however, mean that anyone should be made to feel that
their views or experiences cannot be discussed. If someone is being disruptive,
but not violating any established aspect of this code, the way they are being
disruptive should be considered for exclusion in this code. Punishment should
never be meted out on an individual basis in excess of what is allowed by this
code. Anything that excludes someone from being involved in the PHP community
should be egegrious and continuing in nature.

#### Constructive Content

Generally speaking, content and discussion should be constructive in nature.
While open personal disagreements are not disallowed, they are to be discouraged
if they are not bringing those involved closer to a better understanding.

#### On-Topic

The only restriction on topic that should be applied is to do with whether
there is a better resource for information/discussion. If a discussion would
clearly be better had in a different specific forum, then the participants
should be politely informed of that. As an example, if someone is asking
for help with a specific framework, and an active channel exists for that
framework, they should be guided there instead.

### Administration

#### Apolitical

No modifications to this code of conduct, and no action taken on behalf of the
community should be political in nature. If action is taken as a result of a
disagreement in any political arena, that action should be considered a grave
abuse of power, and responded to appropriately.

#### Non-punitive

At no point should warnings, mutes, or bans be used as a punishment. The
fundamental purpose of any action taken against a community member should be
to temporarily eliminate an ongoing disruption, until an open discussion can
be had with that community member to rectify the behaviour that is problematic.
Only in the case that the community member absolutely refuses to change their
behaviour in our communities should any long-term action be taken against them.

#### Diversity of Views

As much as possible, the administrators of this community should have widely
ranging views. Otherwise, it is very likely that individual views will
sway collective actions. This community is intended to represent and include
everyone, regardless of whether or not the things they believe are
well-respected.

#### Meritocratic

Consideration of whether or not someone should be accepted into the
administrative group of this community should be based entirely on the merit of
the individual as a community leader. The attributes that should be considered
above all else are fairness, influence, involvement, and trustworthiness. What
should never be considered are personal politics or popularity.
