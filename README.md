# PHP Community Guidance

## Purpose

The purpose of this organization is to establish a guidance structure for
PHP community efforts, unified under a common philosophy of inclusion,
professionalism, respect, transparency, and civility.

Chiefly, the guiding idea behind the communities involved is that those
involved are mature professionals, and so we should be able to work out any
conflicts openly, honestly, and civilly.

## Communities

### \#\#phpcg

This channel is intended as the forum in which to discuss this project itself.

### \#\#phphelp

This channel is intended as a general PHP support channel, akin to the existing
\#\#php channel, but with clearer guidelines for ensuring that the support
provided is effective and clear.

### \#\#phptalk

This channel is intended as a general PHP community channel, akin to the
existing \#\#phpc channel, but more inclusive of all views, so long as those
views are expressed in a civil manner. Debate, criticism, politics, and general
friendliness are all expressly encouraged.
